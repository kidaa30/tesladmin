Tesladmin
=========

Tesladmin is an admin page for the `Nikola <http://getnikola.com>`_ static site generator. Note that it's in early beta stages; little is paid to security right now. Work in progress!

Why?
****

Wordpress is slow, and Nikola is awesome.

How do I use it?
****************

Installation
^^^^^^^^^^^^

Make sure you have `Git <https://git-scm.com/>`_, `Python <https://www.python.org/>`_, `Django <https://www.djangoproject.com/>`_,  and `django-tinymce <https://pypi.python.org/pypi/django-tinymce>`_ installed. To install the last two, you can run::
  
  $ pip install django django-tinymce

provided you already have Python and pip installed.

Now, to get Tesladmin, run::
  
  $ git clone https://github.com/kirbyfan64/tesladmin.git

Usage
^^^^^

Everything is based out of `toolbox.py`. When you first download tesladmin, you should run::
   
   $ ./toolbox.py init

to initialize Tesladmin. This will ask you for a password to use for the admin account.

If you want to reset the whole thing, use::
   
   $ ./toolbox.py clean

THIS WILL DELETE YOUR USERS AND ALL YOUR POSTS!!!!

To update the database when you've updated Tesladmin (by running ``git pull``), run::
   
   $ ./toolbox.py update

To run Django's test webserver on port 8000, run::
   
   $ ./toolbox.py

This will automatically run ``./toolbox.py update`` if you've updated Tesladmin.

The admin page is at ``http://localhost:8000/admin`` (this page is auto-generated by Django; I don't know enough web programming to write something that nice), and the main website (generated by Nikola) is at ``http://localhost:8000/site/index.html``.
